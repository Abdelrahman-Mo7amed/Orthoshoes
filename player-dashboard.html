                    <p><strong>Overall Performance:</strong> Mohamed Salah has been consistently outstanding this season, demonstrating exceptional skills as a forward. His agility, speed, and finishing have been instrumental in Liverpool's attacking strategy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recent Matches:</strong> In the last five matches, Salah has scored 7 goals and provided 3 assists. His ability to find the back of the net and create opportunities for his teammates has been a key factor in Liverpool's success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
